# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the site branding to “Electric Light” and add the uploaded logo to the header and footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all visible “SensorTech Electric” brand text on the home page with “Electric Light” (header, About section heading, footer, and footer copyright line).
- Add the uploaded logo image as a static asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` and display it next to the company name in the header and footer with appropriate sizing and alt text.
- Update the HTML document title to include “Electric Light”.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the site branded as “Electric Light” (including page title), with the new logo shown alongside the company name in both the header and footer.
